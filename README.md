# Fantasy Name Generator

I love playing games like FFXIV and Skyrim, which fit into the fantasy genre. In those games as a player, one needs to come up with interesting names to give their characters. It will be their legacy. That's what they will be remembered as!

Well... I suck at coming up with names. I was practicing my React this week, by going back to basics. I followed a Udemy course and one of the projects being worked on was a simple title generator.

That gave me an idea of creating this simple fantasy name generator. It's very much a work in progress but it's very simple. Click on the button and a name is randomly generated for you.
